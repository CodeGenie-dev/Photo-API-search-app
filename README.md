# Photo-API-search-app

For this project, the task was to build a Dynamic Photo Search App with the Pexels API 

Pexels is a copyright-free photo app, one can play around with the app itself and see that it is a great way to get images for websites.

They also provide a free API that is fairly easy to use.

I read through the documentation to figure out how to get JSON with AJAX using a search string as a parameter (just like the YouTube API project)

In order to generate an API key I needed to create an account.

Once I was successfully sending a request (and receiving a JSON response)...

I had to "wire up" this request to an event listener that the user can use to search for different categories of photos.

As for the design, I just partially copied the Pexels Homepage.
